# Storiee

Another FOSS Facebook story downloader written in TypeScript.

## Todos

+ [ ] Merge "server" and "client" together (since we're using NextJS).
+ [ ] Rewrite the frontend.

## Installation

We use Bun for dependency management and NodeJS for runtime.

To install the dependencies:

```
bun install
```

And to start the server (frontend and backend):

```
bun run build
bun run start
```

This will build the server with `swc` and start it on `http://127.0.0.1`
